Greetings people, this is your friendly Electricshmoo bringing you another URLium use-case example.

we got some algebra, we got some statistics, we got some geometry, in the form of.. textured wall and tower building.

we'll start by explaining the 2 tools we're using here, the "URLium Post Wand" that will set locations 
and the "/webcom command" that will send parameters to the server to generate our structure

we have a few commands written in the php script we'll look at later, but the rundown of them are: 


"wall" builds a Wall
"tower" builds a tower

"type" block types ( stone, sand, brick, slate, end) pulling from json files
"height" wall/tower 
"radius" tower only
"step" tower only  angle of increment
"flare" tower only / optional
"extend" tower only / required with flare

now, let's use these settings to turbo-build a small textured fortress

...note we can go up and down terrains on the y axis and the heights are adusted correctly..

and this is just 2 structure commands wall, and tower... image what you could do with just a few more commands

lets's mix wall types...

and tower types...

all in about 350 lines of PHP with the URLium mod and RCON..
